<p>Step 1: Lie flat on your back, like our sleeping pose. Legs should be separated.</p>

<p>Step 2: Keep your arms at your side and your palms facing up. Just relax.</p>

 <p> Step 3:Close your eyes and breathe deeply and slowly through the nostrils.<p> 

<p> Step 4: Start concentrating from your head to your feet. This means you are consciously relaxing your each part of the body. Donâ€™t move ahead without relaxing particular part of the body.</p>
 
<p>Step 5: On each inhaling and exhaling (breathing) think that your body is totally relaxed. Let your tension, stress, depression and worry run away on each exhaling.
</p>

<p>Note: Those having good concentrations can practice for a long time and others can practice for 3-5 minutes.
