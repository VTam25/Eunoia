<h1> Exercise Three</h1>

<p><font size ="2"> A quick option to refresh your body is to run. Go outside and move around. If you aren't feeling energized, walk around your room. For running, you could also jog for 1 minute then rest for a 30 seconds. You can repeat this with different running exercises. </font></p>
