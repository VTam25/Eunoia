<h1> Exercise </h1>

<p>Sometimes, the best way to relieve stress or stay in good shape is to exercise. While overexerting yourself is dangerous, light exercises promote well-being by making sure your blood runs smoothly through important areas of your body.</p>

<p>One simple exercise you can try is stretching. To start off, stretch your arms, you can clamp your right arm in the elbow of your left arm and pull both arms towards your left. Then, reverse positions and pull towards the right. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish, but your arms will feel more free even after five to eight cycles.</p>

<p>Another stretch is when you extend one leg out in front of you. Keep the leg straight and place the bottom of your foot against the straightened knee. Reach both arms towards the farther foot and hold for 10 seconds. Switch legs and reapeat. </p>

<p>Another quick option to refresh your body is running. Go outside and move around in the fresh air. If you aren't feeling very energized, you can walk around your living space or outside. Walking and running wakes up the arms, legs, and most importantly, the lungs.</p>

<p>For running, you could also jog for 1 minute then rest for a few seconds. Hind knees is where you jog and simutaneously bring one leg up to a right angle at a time. This exercise helps with endurance and quad strength. Butt kicks is when you literally kick your butt with each stride. And this exercise helps strengthen your hamstrings. </p>

<p>Just a few non-intensive movements can get the blood flowing and take stress off of your mind.</p>
