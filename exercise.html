<h1> Exercise </h1>

<p>The best way to relieve stress or stay in good shape is to exercise. While overexerting yourself is dangerous, light exercises promote well-being. </p>

<p>One simple exercise is stretching. To start off, stretch your arms and clamp your right arm in the elbow of your left arm and pull both arms towards your left. Then, reverse positions and pull towards the right. </p>

<p>Another stretch is to extend one leg out in front of you. Keep the leg straight and place the bottom of your foot against the straightened knee. Reach both arms towards the farther foot and hold for 10 seconds. Switch legs and repeat. </p>

<p>Also, a quick option to refresh your body is to run. Go outside and move around. If you aren't feeling energized, walk around your room. </p>

<p>For running, you could also jog for 1 minute then rest for a few seconds. Hind knees is where you jog and simutaneously bring one leg up to a right angle at a time. This exercise helps with endurance and quad strength. Butt kicks is when you literally kick your butt with each stride. And this exercise helps strengthen your hamstrings. </p>

<p>Just a few non-intensive movements can get the blood flowing and take stress off of your mind.</p>
